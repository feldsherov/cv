\begin{cvsection}{EXPERIENCE}
  \cvinfobox{Google Cloud, Virtual Network Dataplane Telemetry}{ 08.2022-present | Software Engineer}
  {Working on packet sampling in virtual network data plane. Main part is instrumentation of virtual
  networking components with packet sampling. \\
  Technologies: internal DPDK-like framework, C++ in network data plane plus gRPC and C++ for packet samples processing. \\
  Main achievements are instrumentation of a new data plane component with packet sampling,
  2-10\% fast path packet processing speedup by moving expensive syscalls out of fast path, and framework for 
  simplification of packet drops debugging.}
  
  \cvinfobox{Yandex Search}{ 06.2020-06.2022 | Software Engineer / Team Lead}
  {Team I led was working on a company-wide microservices framework, which serves
  1000 microservices, 10 million requests per second.\\
  We used C++ for data plane, Python for control plane, and tests/infrastructure.\\
  Main achievements are 99.999\% availability, HTTP transport replacement
  with faster implementation, speedup of distributed tracing over our
  framework from minute to 1-3sec per request.}

  \cvinfobox{Yandex Search}{ 11.2018-06.2020 | Software Engineer}
  {Worked on Search Infrastructure team. C++, Python, gRPC, networking.
  Designed and implemented SDCH support for Search Engine Result Page.
  Main part was C++ backend with custom SDCH implementation.\\
  Improved search query preprocessing pipeline. Reimplemented part of business logic with C++, 
  fixed some architectural problems, speedup on 5-10ms on the affected slice of traffic.}
  
  \cvinfobox{Google}{07.2018-10.2018 | Software Engineering Intern}
  {Worked on Shopping Data Quality team. Primary C++, MapReduce, Stubby.
   Designed and implemented an infrastructure for intellectual scheduling of merchants review. This infrastructure helped to improve existing scheduling logic
   and allowed the team to migrate from several legacy services.}
  
   \cvinfobox{Yandex Ads}{03.2017-06.2018 | Junior Backend Developer}
  {Designed and implemented distributed log collection and event
   plotting system using internal technologies, including YTsaurus â€” Bigtable-like
   storage with MapReduce framework on top of it. \\
   Used coroutine-based web server and batch requests in order
   to handle required RPS on a small number of servers and not to overload
   other services. \\
   This feature enabled the frontend team to log any client-side
   event (usually JS code in a browser) and plot number of any events on
   clients in real time.}

  \cvinfobox{Mail.ru Group, Tarantool}
  {02.2016-12.2016 | Software Engineering Intern}
  {Tarantool is an in-memory NoSQL database implemented in C with some C++.\\
   Implemented a proof of concept version of SQL in Tarantool.
   We combined SQLite parser and execution engine with Tarantool internal structures (B+*-tree).\\
   Fixed some bugs in Tarantool test engine.\\
   Added intrusive heap to Tarantool data structures library.}
